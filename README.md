# Chinook PostgreSQL Database (case insensitive)

Chinook is a sample database made public by [Luis Rocha](https://github.com/lerocha). The original database is available for SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. It is ideal for demos and testing ORM tools targeting single and multiple database servers.

This repository is based on [the original Chinook Database](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database). The only difference is that the SQL file that creates and populates the database is case insensitive.
